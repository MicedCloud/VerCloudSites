            <h1>Terms of Services</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h2>Refunds</h2>
                    <p>We regret to inform you that refunds are not available for VX purchases. Upon purchasing VX, you are bound by our "No Refunds" policy. It's essential to understand that you bear full responsibility for your purchases, and accidental deletion of VX does not qualify for a refund. To initiate a refund request, you must furnish comprehensive proof of your original purchase.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Risks Associated with ValorantX</h2>
                    <p>Utilizing ValorantX in-game poses a substantial risk of incurring a ban on your Valorant account. Valorant explicitly prohibits the use of third-party services like ValX, considering them a violation of their terms of service. To mitigate this risk, we strongly advise employing a separate account and device dedicated solely to ValX to evade potential "HWID" bans, which target the hardware ID of your device.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Prohibition on Debugging/Modifying ValX Code</h2>
                    <p>Any form of editing or attempting to modify ValX's code is strictly forbidden. This encompasses debugging or tampering with the code in any manner. Violations of this policy will result in a ban from accessing the software, thereby revoking your VX privileges.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>ValorantX Data Storage and Logging</h2>
                    <p>ValX meticulously logs all game activities, bans, and purchases within a secure database, accessible solely by authorized ValX staff and administrators. This data serves to enhance your user experience by automatically generating game clips and providing assistance in the event of a ban. Should you encounter a ban, you can swiftly initiate a support ticket to notify us.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>End-to-End Encryption</h2>
                    <p>Even the organization responsible for managing ValX's database lacks access to its contents; only select ValX staff possess authorization. In the event of a breach, the encrypted file becomes unreadable. Any decryption attempt triggers alerts to the VerCloud data system, prompting automatic deletion of all information from the database and file. This ensures utmost security and confidentiality of user data.</p>
                </li>
                <li>

                    <p>Using ValorantX entails adherence to Valorant's community guidelines and terms of service. Any violation of these guidelines, whether through in-game behavior or the use of third-party software, may result in penalties imposed by Valorant, including temporary or permanent account suspension.</p>
